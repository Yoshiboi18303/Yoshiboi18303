# Hello!
I'm *Yoshiboi18303*!

---

## What am I?
I am a gamer and developer!

---

## What do I develop?
I am mainly a **web developer**, although I do develop other stuff like Discord bots. I am also wanting to become a mobile app developer at some point, so stay tuned!

---

## What languages do I develop in?

- I mainly use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for most of my personal projects
- I use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) for my websites for the time being

I also use Python sometimes for small personal scripts as well as PowerShell.

---

## What do I use?

Mainly [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for development, but once I have money for the JetBrains IDEs, you bet I'm dropping that part of Microsoft.

I also use **Windows 11 Pro** for now, until Linux is mostly stable hardware wise ([read here for more info](https://gist.github.com/Yoshiboi18303/ae9a56abc27502005c8fd58bdaee5126)).
