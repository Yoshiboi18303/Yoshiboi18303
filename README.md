# NOTE

This account is now dead, I'm moving to **[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Yoshiboi18303)** to get away from Microsoft for a bit.

# Hello!
I'm *Yoshiboi18303*!

---

## What am I?
I am a gamer and developer!

---

## What do I develop?
I am mainly a **web developer**, although I do develop other stuff like Discord bots. I am also wanting to become a mobile app and game developer at some point, so stay tuned!

---

## What languages do I develop in?

- I mainly use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for most of my personal projects
- I use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) for my websites for the time being
- I am also currently trying to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to move away from TypeScript

I also use Python sometimes for small personal scripts as well as PowerShell/Bash.

---

## What do I use?

Mainly [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for development, but once I have money for the JetBrains IDEs, you bet I'm dropping that part of Microsoft.

I also use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) after getting fed up with Microsoft, trying to learn Neovim as well.
